## Routing Rules, Handoffs, and Playbook Management

Define routing by channel, keyword, or intent. Use handoffs for seamless teammate transfers, and manage versioned playbooks for auditable workflows.

    A[New Message] --> B{Routing Rule Match?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Assign to Agent/Team]
    B -->|No| D[AI Escalation]
    C --> E[Timeline Update]
    D --> E
    E --> F[Customer Response]
```

<Expandable title="Advanced Playbook Configuration" default-open="false">

      "version": "1.2"
    }
